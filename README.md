# TikTalk

Developing an app that displays TikTok's most popular sounds, creators, and a function that allows the user to match their audio input to a popular TikTok sound. This is an iOS that integrates web data extraction and a custom Parse backend server hosted on Back4App.

## Setup/Installation üèó


1. MacOS/Windows
2. Download and install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) or [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. After downloading your package manager, download and install [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
4. In the project directory, execute the following command `yarn` or `npm install` depending on which package manager you downloaded.
5. Finally, in the same directory, execute the command `expo run:ios` or `expo run:android` depending on the used simulator

## Parse API

We used [**Parse**](https://parseplatform.org/) (hosted on [**Back4app**](https://www.back4app.com/)) as our backend to handle the databases used to hold data regarding sounds and creators information.

[**Beautiful Soup**](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) was used to web scrape websites for data regarding the most popular tiktok sounds and creators.


## Database

We used [**mongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [**Parse server**](https://parseplatform.org/), hosted on [**Back4App**](https://www.back4app.com/) to manage our data for the application. This helps students focus more on how iOS works connecting to a database and not get distracted or overloaded with learning backend development. 

### Schema

Below is the database schema for our simple Parse Databases.

**Sounds**

| Name       | Type   | Descrpition                          |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| rank   | int | popularity ranking |
| song_status_code | int | status code of song_url |
| title   | string | sound title               |
| artist | string | sound artist |
| views | string | views of sound |
| song_url | string | URL of sound to TikTok |
| image_url | string | URL of soud image |


**Creators**

| Name       | Type   | Descrpition                          |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| rank   | int | popularity ranking |
| user | string | creator username |
| nickname | string | creator nickname |
| location | string | creator location |
| followers | string | total following on TikTok |
| videos | string | total videos on TikTok |
| likes | string | total likes on TikTok|
| image_url | string | URL of soud image |
